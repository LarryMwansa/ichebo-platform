# Ichebo Platform — Master Build Roadmap

**Version:** v7 — 2026-05-13 (Canonical)
**Previous version:** v6 — 2026-04-27
**Status:** Approved — Definitive Reference
**Supersedes:** All previous roadmap versions (v1–v6)

> This is the single authoritative roadmap for the entire Ichebo platform and ecosystem. It covers every phase, every product, every technology decision, and every deferred item. No other roadmap supersedes this document.
>
> **How this was produced:** v6 (2026-04-27) was the canonical consolidation of all build history through Version 2 planning. This v7 amendment: (1) marks all Version 2 phases as complete, (2) adds the Apostolic Command Shell as a named architectural component, (3) adds DESIGN.md as a locked design authority reference, (4) adds Ichebo Desktop and the ecosystem product family, (5) adds the Go engine layer and Sync Engine, (6) updates the Layer and Phase structure to reflect the ecosystem vision, and (7) aligns all references to the ADR set (ADR-001 through ADR-021).

---

## How to Read This Document

Every phase has four things:
- **What it builds** — the specific features and files
- **Entry requirement** — what must be complete before this phase starts
- **Exit criteria** — how you know the phase is done
- **Commit** — the git commit message when the phase closes

Phases are numbered. Within a phase, tasks are lettered. Do not skip phases. Do not start a task before its entry requirement is met.

---

## Platform Overview

**What Ichebo is:** A Kingdom Governance System (KGS) platform — the digital expression of the Kingdom Governance System framework developed by Ichebo Christian Services, led by Paul Reuben (Founder and Principal Leader). The platform enables Christian organisations to digitally manage governance, discipleship, and ministry operations across three product surfaces.

**Three client surfaces:**

| Surface | Technology | Primary user | Role |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Ichebo Web** (app.ichebo.org) | Django templates + HTMX | Level 3–5 stewards, coordinators, architects | Apostolic Command Shell — desktop governance and operations |
| **Ichebo Mobile** | Flutter + DRF API | All users Level 0b–5 | Daily companion — lessons, activities, community, Bible |
| **Ichebo Desktop** | Flutter + SQLite + Go Sync Engine | Community steward | Local-first community operating system — offline-capable |

**Backend:** Django 4.2 LTS + Django REST Framework + PostgreSQL. One backend, two web/mobile clients. DRF API serves Flutter Mobile and Ichebo Desktop sync. Go engine layer (Version 3+) provides portable domain logic.

**Infrastructure:** Hetzner VPS (Ubuntu 22.04), Nginx, Gunicorn, systemd. Hetzner Object Storage (S3-compatible, bucket: ics-media) for file and media storage.

## Architecture Decisions (Locked)

These decisions are final. They cannot be changed without producing a new ADR. Do not re-open them.

| ADR | Decision | What it means |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| ADR-001 (amended) | Flutter for all client surfaces | Flutter targets Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux), Mobile (Android-first, iOS later). Not HTMX. Consumes DRF API. |
| ADR-002 | Django 4.2 LTS | Long-term support. Do not upgrade to 5.x without a new ADR. |
| ADR-003 | Single records table with discriminator | All content uses one records table with record_family / record_type discriminator. No new model tables for content types. |
| ADR-004 | DRF retained for mobile and sync | /api/ endpoints are the mobile API and the sync target for Ichebo Desktop. |
| ADR-005 | Django templates + HTMX for web | No React, Vue, or JS framework on the web. HTMX handles dynamic interactions. |
| ADR-006 | competence_level one write path | Only POST /api/learn/certifications/{id}/confirm/ may increment competence_level. Nothing else. |
| ADR-007 | URL-based video only in Version 2 | No self-hosted video transcoding in Version 2. YouTube/Vimeo iframe embed only. Ichebo Media is Version 3+. |
| ADR-008 | No Celery or Redis until Version 3 | All automation uses Django signals (synchronous) or cron management commands. |
| ADR-009 | No Docker until Version 3 | Nginx + Gunicorn + systemd is the production stack. |
| ADR-010 | Paraclete is rule-based in MVP | Pure Python. No LLM calls. Reads ORM, returns digest. Writes nothing. |
| ADR-011 | KGS programme and curriculum structure | Five qualification programmes (Certificate → Doctorate), four induction lessons, eight pathways. See VERSION_2_PLANNING for full specification. |
| ADR-012 | Apostolic Command Shell | Four-column desktop governance interface. Level 3+ only. The canonical desktop web surface. |
| ADR-013 | DESIGN.md + design-preview.html as locked design authority | All visual decisions governed by DESIGN.md. design-preview.html is the canonical visual reference. Neither may be contradicted without amendment. |
| ADR-014 | The Desk as governance authorship surface | Canonical authorship environment within the Apostolic Command Shell. All governance record creation routes through The Desk. |
| ADR-015 | Dual-shell rendering architecture | Stage Mode (Level 3+, desktop) and Mobile Mode (all users, mobile) are two first-class rendering paths. Neither is a degradation of the other. |
| ADR-016 | Local-first as Ichebo architectural philosophy | Device is primary computer. Cloud is coordination. Applies to Ichebo Desktop and native Flutter Mobile. Does not change the Django cloud platform. |
| ADR-017 | Ichebo Desktop as primary product | Desktop is the primary product. Cloud exists to coordinate and give visibility to local installations. MVP: People + Activity + Sync. |
| ADR-018 | Sync Engine as standalone Go binary | Bidirectional, conflict-aware sync engine. ChangeLog, Push/Pull/Resolve, conflict rules by data type. The strategic secret sauce. |
| ADR-019 | Go as language for foundation engines | Records Engine, Activity Engine, Relationships Engine, Bible Engine, Calendar Engine, Sync Engine — all Go modules. Django is the web layer and API adapter. |
| ADR-020 | Ichebo Handbook as standalone product | Supersedes Handbook-as-tenant decision. Handbook is institutional memory that precedes all tenants. Handbook-as-tenant remains in production pending migration. |
| ADR-021 | Ichebo Media as standalone product | Full video engine — upload, transcode, store, serve, live stream. Go + FFmpeg + Hetzner Object Storage + HLS. Version 3+. |
| Email | Email via Brevo | Free tier (300 emails/day). SMTP integration via Django email backend. |

---

## Design Authority

**DESIGN.md** is the locked design system authority for all Ichebo surfaces (ADR-013). **design-preview.html** is its canonical visual reference implementation. Both are co-equal authorities.

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Primary Red | #AF3236 |
| Secondary Blue | #185ABC |
| Ink | #0E0E0E |
| Stone | #F5F3F0 |
| Display font | Playfair Display (700, 800, 900) |
| UI font | Inter (400, 500, 600) |
| Monospace | Fira Code (400) |

Pink (#FFC0CB or similar) is never a valid accent colour. All pink instances are bugs.

---

## Dependency Rules (Non-Negotiable)

```
Django auth → Django tenant → Django records engine → Django activity engine
Django models → DRF serializers → DRF views → DRF URLs
DRF endpoints live → Django template views → HTMX partials
Records engine complete → Activity engine begin
Activity engine complete → Learn App begin (Learn uses Activity for progress tracking)
All Phase 5 apps complete → Paraclete service begin
Paraclete service complete → Dashboard begin
One app per git commit — never mix app work across a single commit

Ecosystem (Version 3+):
UUID schema locked → ChangeLog built → Go engines built → Sync Engine built → Desktop UI built
```

# LAYER 4 — Stabilisation & Handoff (Current)

## Phase H.1 — Documentation Alignment

**Goal:** Align all reference documents with the Version 2 completed build. Produce canonical versions of all key documents.

**What this produces:**
- Master Roadmap v7 (this document) ✅
- Data Contract v11 (canonical) ✅
- ADR set ADR-012 through ADR-021 ✅
- Ecosystem Architecture v0.1 ✅
- DESIGN.md (locked) ✅

**Exit criteria:** All reference documents reflect the completed Version 2 build and the ecosystem architecture direction.

## Phase H.2 — Version 2 in Real-World Use

**Goal:** Get the platform in front of real communities. Collect real usage data. Validate KGS implementation in practice.

**Entry requirement:** Phase H.1 complete. Flutter Mobile MVP functional on Android.

**Exit criteria:** At least one Sceptre Community operating on the platform. Real formation journeys in progress. Real governance records in the Handbook.

---

# LAYER 5 — Version 3: Ecosystem Foundation

**Entry requirement:** Version 2 in real-world use (Phase H.2). At least one community operating.

**Note:** Do not start Layer 5 until the domain is proven in real use. Version 2 may surface requirements that change the ecosystem design. The ecosystem architecture document (v0.1) will have been updated by real-world learning before Layer 5 begins.

## Phase E.1 — UUID Schema Migration

**Goal:** Migrate all primary keys from auto-increment integers to UUID across the entire codebase. This is the foundation for local-first data and the Sync Engine.

**Entry requirement:** Version 2 stable in production. No active migration in progress.

**What changes:**
- All Django model PKs: UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
- All DRF serializers: updated to UUID field types
- All API clients: updated to handle UUID responses
- All template references to record IDs: updated

**Non-negotiable:** UUID migration must be complete before any Go engine work begins.

**Commit:** `chore: uuid primary key migration — all models`

## Phase E.2 — Soft Delete Pattern

**Goal:** Implement soft deletes across all models. No hard deletes anywhere in the system.

**What changes:**
- All models: add deleted_at DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
- All querysets: default filter to deleted_at IS NULL
- All DRF endpoints: PATCH to set deleted_at instead of DELETE
- All admin views: show deleted records separately

**Commit:** `chore: soft delete pattern — all models`

## Phase E.3 — Go Engine Foundation

**Goal:** Build the six Go foundation engines as standalone modules.

**Entry requirement:** E.1 and E.2 complete.

**Build order:**
1. Records Engine (Go module) — enforce record_class rules, record_family/record_type taxonomy, four mandatory fields
2. Activity Engine (Go module) — ActivityLog, progress logic, participation events
3. Relationships Engine (Go module) — direction-aware traversal, HRS methodology
4. Bible Engine (Go module) — scripture text, translation resolution, reference parsing
5. Calendar Engine (Go module) — event aggregation, KGS Annual Rhythm, programme milestones

Each engine: independently compilable, independently testable, own version, language-agnostic specification document.

**Commit pattern:** `feat(engine): records-engine v0.1`, `feat(engine): activity-engine v0.1`, etc.

## Phase E.4 — Sync Engine

**Goal:** Build the Sync Engine as a standalone Go binary.

**Entry requirement:** E.3 complete (all foundation engines built and tested).

**Reference:** ADR-018

**Build sequence:**

2. Device identity (UUID on first run)
3. Push implementation (POST /api/sync/push/)
4. Pull implementation (GET /api/sync/pull/?since=)
5. Conflict resolution rules by data type
6. ConflictQueue
7. 7-day offline test

**Commit:** `feat: sync-engine v0.1 — changelog, push, pull, resolve`

# LAYER 6 — Version 3: Ichebo Desktop

**Entry requirement:** Layer 5 complete. Sync Engine tested and proven.

**Reference:** ADR-017

## Phase D.1 — Flutter Desktop Project

**Goal:** Flutter project setup targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux. Design system tokens in Dart. Core navigation shell.

## Phase D.2 — Local Data Layer

**Goal:** SQLite integration (WAL mode), Go engine FFI bridge, all local writes append to ChangeLog.

## Phase D.3 — People Surface

**Goal:** Member registry, competence levels, shepherd assignments. Full offline operation.

## Phase D.4 — Activity Surface

**Goal:** Log attendance, service, participation. HTMX replaced with Flutter state management.

## Phase D.5 — Sync Surface

**Goal:** Sync status bar (four states), background sync goroutine, ConflictQueue review UI.

## Phase D.6 — KGS Onboarding

**Goal:** Cloud KGS compliance verification, licence key issuance, Desktop activation flow, initial sync payload.

**Exit criteria:** A community steward can install Ichebo Desktop, activate with a licence key, add members, log activities, go offline for 7 days, and sync cleanly when reconnected.

---

# LAYER 7 — Version 3: Ichebo Mobile (Flutter)

**Entry requirement:** Layer 5 complete (Go engines available). Can run in parallel with Layer 6.

**Note:** This is the full Flutter native mobile app — distinct from the Django Mobile Mode (which remains as web fallback). The Flutter app is the primary mobile surface long-term.

**Reference:** ADR-001 (amended), ADR-015

Build sequence mirrors V2.M screen list above but with native Flutter implementation calling Go engines locally (offline) and DRF API (online).

---

# LAYER 8 — Version 3: Ichebo Media

**Entry requirement:** Layer 5 complete. Video/Live App URL approach proven insufficient or network video hosting confirmed as direction.

**Reference:** ADR-021

## Phase M.1 — Video Engine

**Goal:** Go + FFmpeg upload pipeline, Hetzner Object Storage integration, transcoding queue, multiple quality outputs, CDN delivery.

## Phase M.2 — Live Streaming

**Goal:** MediaMTX or nginx-rtmp RTMP ingest, HLS delivery, DVR recording, archive on stream end.

## Phase M.3 — Learning Video

**Goal:** Chapter markers, completion tracking (Activity Engine), offline download for Desktop, progress reporting to Paraclete.

---

# LAYER 9 — Version 3: Ichebo Handbook ✅ COMPLETE

**Entry requirement:** Layer 5 complete. The Desk (ADR-014) proven design pattern. Handbook-as-tenant migration planned.

**Reference:** ADR-020, DOC F

## Phase K.1 — Handbook Product Foundation ✅

**What was built:** Standalone `handbook` Django app. `HandbookRecord` (UUID PK, three branches, four status lifecycle, version chain), `HandbookRelationship` (HRS + scripture links in one model), `HandbookAccess` (reader/author/editor roles, global scope). Full DRF API: list/create, detail/patch, publish, lock, new-version, history. Migration `0001_initial` applied.

**Commit:** `feat(handbook): K.1 — Handbook product foundation`

## Phase K.2 — Workspace UI + The Desk ✅

**What was built:** Four-column Apostolic Command Shell for the Handbook — `home.html` (branch navigator, record list grouped by type), `record.html` (four-tab Properties Sidecar: Props/HRS/Scripture/History, `HBDesk` JS object, auto-save on keystroke), `access.html` (editor-only access management). Sidebar nav entry added to `workspace_shell.html`. Template URLs registered at `/handbook/`.

**Commit:** `feat(handbook): K.2 — Workspace UI and The Desk`

## Phase K.3 — HRS Relationships ✅

**What was built:** `HandbookRelationship` model with seven relationship types (part_of, derived_from, aligns_with, authorised_by, references, has_symbol, matches_pattern), direction field, six HRS attribute fields on `HandbookRecord` (complexity, relationship_position, position, direction, speed, emotional_tone). `HandbookRelationshipListCreateView` + `HandbookRelationshipDeleteView`. HRS tab in The Desk with relationship list and add form.

## Phase K.4 — Scripture Linking ✅

**What was built:** `HandbookRelationship.bible_verse` FK to `bible.BibleVerse`. Scripture tab in The Desk with verse search and link/unlink workflow. `clean()` enforces exactly one of `to_record`/`bible_verse` per relationship.

## Phase K.5 — Publish Feed ✅

**What was built:** `GET /api/handbook/publish-feed/?since={timestamp}` — returns active/locked non-key records modified since timestamp, 100-record window, ordered by `updated_at`. Used by Sync Engine delta pull.

## Phase K.6 — Keys Library Privacy ✅

**What was built:** Keys Library isolation invariant — key records are personal (owner-only), no `HandbookAccess` required to create/read/edit, never visible to other users including editors, blocked from publish and lock lifecycle, excluded from the publish feed. Enforced via `_is_key_record()`, `_assert_can_access_record()`, `_assert_can_write_record()` helpers across all API views and workspace views. 13 passing tests covering all privacy invariants.

**Commit:** `feat(handbook): K.6 — Keys Library privacy invariant`

---

# LAYER 10 — Scale

**Entry requirement:** Do not build any of these until Version 3 is in real-world use and a specific bottleneck has been identified. Layer 10 is demand-driven, not time-driven.

## Phase L10.1 — Redis + Celery ✅ COMPLETE

**What was built:** Full async task queue infrastructure. Redis as broker (DB 0) and Django cache backend (DB 1, replaces FileBasedCache). Celery 5.3.6 with django-celery-beat 2.6.0. `ics_project/celery.py` entry point, `ics_project/__init__.py` wired. `notifications/tasks.py` — `send_notification_email` (async Brevo SMTP, 3 retries) + `send_fcm_push` (async FCM, 3 retries — FCM wired for the first time). `paraclete/tasks.py` — `refresh_paraclete_digest` + `refresh_all_active_digests` (scheduled every 10 minutes via CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE). All notification email and FCM calls now off the request thread. Paraclete digest pre-computed on schedule, cache TTL bumped to 600s. `deploy/ics-celery.service` and `deploy/ics-celery-beat.service` systemd units.

**ADR-008 lifted:** Celery deferred until Version 3 in real-world use. That gate is passed.

**Commit:** `feat(infra): L10.1 — Redis + Celery async task queue`

## Phase L10.2 — Docker Compose ⏳

**Goal:** Containerise the full stack (web, db, redis, celery-worker, celery-beat, nginx) for reproducible deployment and easier developer onboarding. Replaces the manual Nginx + Gunicorn + systemd setup.

**Entry requirement:** Real-world production use proven stable. Actual need for easier deployment or horizontal scaling confirmed.

**ADR-009 lifts** when this phase begins.

## Phase L10.3 — Django Channels + WebSockets ⏳

**Goal:** Replace HTMX 60-second notification polling with instant WebSocket delivery. Unlock real-time notification push, live stream status updates, and future community chat.

**Entry requirement:** L10.1 complete (Redis already running as channel layer backend). Polling identified as a felt user problem — i.e., real users on the platform noticing the 60-second lag.

## Phase L10.4 — Paraclete AI (LLM) ⏳

**Goal:** LLM-generated formation insights via Celery async tasks. Rule-based fallback retained. New ADR-022 required before implementation (LLM provider, data boundary rules, cost management).

**Entry requirement:** L10.1 complete. Real usage data showing formation patterns. ADR-022 written and approved.

**ADR-010 lifts** when this phase begins.

## Phase L10.5 — iOS (Flutter) ⏳

**Goal:** iOS build of the Flutter mobile app submitted to App Store.

**Entry requirement:** Android app stable in production. Mac with Xcode available. Apple Developer account ($99/year) active.

## Open Decisions

| Decision | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Induction programme lesson content | ⏳ Open — seeded as structure; lesson content authored by Level 4+ after platform is live |
| Induction duration (configurable vs fixed 12-week) | ⏳ Open — default is programme completion; configurable duration deferred to Version 3 |
| Ichebo Desktop pricing model | ⏳ Open — per-installation vs per-seat vs network licence |
| Go engine specification format | ⏳ Open — each engine needs a language-agnostic spec document before Go implementation begins |
